# C - Bit manipulation
<p align="center"> <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/intranet-projects-files/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/232/bitwise.PNG" /> </p>

## Description
`Bit manipulation` is the act of algorithmically manipulating bits or other pieces of data shorter than a word. Bit manipulation is something that has constant time complexity. Bit manipulation is also the process of applying logical operations on a sequence of bits to achieve a required result.

Some **Computer programming** tasks that require bit manipulation include:

> - Low-level device control
> - Error detection and correction algorithms
> - Data compression
> - Encryption algorithms
> - Optimization

## Contents
- File 0-binary_to_uint.c is a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int.

- File 1-print_binary.c is a function that prints the binary representation of a number.

- File 2-get_bit.c is a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.

- File 3-set_bit.c is a function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.

- File 4-clear_bit.c is a function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.

- File 5-flip_bits.c is a function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.

- File 100-get_endianness.c is a function that checks if the machine is Little Endian or Big Endian.

- File 101-password is a password for the program ./crackme3.

- File main.h is the header file containing all the function prototypes of this project.
