# C - Debugging
## Description
This directory contains some debugging exercises based on a previous pproject I worked on - [C - Variable, if, else, while](https://github.com/TosinISOGUN/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while).

## Contents
* File 0-main.c is adapted from file [0-positive_or_negative.c](https://github.com/TosinISOGUN/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/0-positive_or_negative.c). This file tests that the function positive_or_negative() gives the correct output when given a case of 0.
* File 1-main.c has to do with commenting out (donâ€™t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.
* File 2-largest_number.c contains a program that correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.
* File 3-print_remaining_days.c contains a program that converts a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in the year, taking leap year into consideration.
* File main.h is the header file containing all the function prototypes used in this project.
