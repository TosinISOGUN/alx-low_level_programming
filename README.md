# ALX LOW LEVEL PROGRAMMING
Getting started with low-level programminging in C Language.

## Description
I've recently began my software engineering career at ALX, and as part of requirement we were asked to learn C programming language, over the next few months I would be applying the knowledge learnt to solving basic tasks in C language.
